Pulseboard - Life Tracker (V1) - Product Feature Summary

Overview
Pulseboard helps you plan, execute, and measure personal tasks across core life categories (Health, Strength, Mind, Work, Spirit). It provides a calendar, progress analytics, category insights, and CSV-powered bulk imports.

Navigation
- Dashboard/Progress: Lifetime stats overview, trends, categories breakdown, goals highlights.
- Calendar: Create, edit, complete, and view tasks by date; filter by category/status.
- Expenses & Investments: Placeholder sections for future finance tracking.
- Profile: Account actions including CSV bulk task import.

Core Concepts
- Tasks: name, description, duration, optional date, categories, points per category, status (pending/in-progress/completed).
- Points: Positive when completed on/before due date. Negative equivalents applied for overdue pending/in-progress tasks on the due date (impact lifetime totals).
- Categories: Health, Strength, Mind, Work, Spirit.
- Users: Identified via Cognito (userId from JWT sub).

Key Features
1) Calendar & Task Management
- Add/Edit/Delete a task.
- Set dated or undated tasks; filter by date, status, or category.
- Sorted ascending by date (undated tasks listed last).
- Pagination applied after sorting for consistent UI.

2) Bulk CSV Import (Profile)
- Upload CSV via UI to import historical tasks.
- Parses quoted fields, converts DD-MMM-YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD, splits category lists, and maps points like '1,2' -> {health:1, strength:2}.
- CORS-safe via API Gateway configuration (allowOrigins:* for development; credentials false).
- Admin password gate supported (configurable).

3) Lifetime Points
- Backend /points?period=lifetime returns:
  - categories: actual earned points (incl. negative overdue penalties).
  - total: sum of category actuals.
  - totalPossible: achievable points per category from all tasks up to today regardless of completion.
  - totalPossibleTotal: sum of achievable points.
- UI lifetime bars:
  - Bar max = totalPossible per category; value = actual (floored at 0 for display).
  - Label shows percentage (rounded).

4) Trends (Daily Cumulative Line Chart)
- Endpoint /points/daily-cumulative?date_from=YYYY-MM-DD&date_to=YYYY-MM-DD.
- Series starts from lifetime totals as of the day before startDate, ensuring continuity (does not reset to 0).
- Per-day points include completed positives and overdue negatives.

5) Categories Pie (Range Totals)
- Uses /points with date_from & date_to; distribution taken from totals within range.
- Displays non-negative values for readability; percentages computed from displayed totals.

6) Goals (MVP demo + real)
- Demo goals visible without auth; real CRUD available when signed in.
- Auto-sync of goal progress after points refresh.

7) Authentication
- Cognito-based; backend extracts userId from JWT sub claim.

Data Model & Infra
- DynamoDB single-table with PK=USER#{sub}, SK=TASK#{id}.
- Query by PK with begins_with(SK,'TASK#'); app-side sort & paginate.
- AWS Lambda + API Gateway with global CORS preflight allowing all origins (dev) to prevent CORS issues.

Developer Notes
- Frontend: React + TypeScript (Vite), Recharts, date-fns, shadcn/ui-like components.
- Backend: Node TypeScript Lambdas; scripts for CSV direct upload, userId migration, task counts.
- CORS: Consistent headers and API GW preflight across endpoints.

Known Placeholders / Future Work
- Expenses: Placeholder page and upcoming APIs (not implemented).
- Investments: Placeholder portfolio view (limited functionality).
- Achievements list includes demo data when not authenticated.
- Advanced goals analytics, reminders/notifications not yet implemented.

User Workflows
- Import history: Profile -> Upload CSV -> confirm; data appears in Calendar and Progress after processing.
- Review progress: Progress -> Lifetime bars (percent), Trends (date range), Categories (range).
- Manage tasks: Calendar -> create/edit/complete; verify order and filters.

Release Summary (V1)
- CSV-driven data import with robust parsing.
- Correct lifetime scaling using totalPossible; negative overdue handling.
- Daily cumulative with lifetime baseline.
- Asc-date sorting with app-side pagination in /tasks.
- Global CORS stability for all endpoints.
